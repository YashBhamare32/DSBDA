Observations:

1. The histogram shows that the distribution of ticket prices (fare) is right-skewed, with a peak towards the lower fare values and a long tail extending towards higher fare values.
2. The majority of passengers seem to have paid lower fares, as indicated by the higher frequency of lower fare values.
3. There are relatively fewer passengers who paid higher fares, suggesting that premium tickets were less common among passengers.
4. The presence of a long tail towards higher fare values indicates that there were some passengers who purchased more expensive tickets, potentially for higher class accommodations or additional amenities.
5. The kernel density estimate curve overlaid on the histogram provides a smoother representation of the fare distribution, showing a gradual decrease in frequency as fare values increase.
6. Overall, the distribution of ticket prices suggests that the Titanic accommodated passengers from various socioeconomic backgrounds, with the majority opting for more affordable fare options.
