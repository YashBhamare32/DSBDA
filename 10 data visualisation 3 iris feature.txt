OBSERVATIONS:
To compare distributions and identify outliers in the Iris dataset, we can analyze the histograms and boxplots generated from the code provided earlier.

Histograms:
- Sepal Length: The distribution appears approximately normal, with no clear outliers.
- Sepal Width: The distribution shows a slight skew towards higher values, with a few outliers on the lower end.
- Petal Length: The distribution shows distinct clusters, suggesting different groups or species within the dataset. There are no clear outliers.
- Petal Width: Similar to petal length, the distribution also shows distinct clusters with no clear outliers.

Boxplots:
- Sepal Length: There are no outliers, and the distribution seems fairly symmetric.
- Sepal Width: The boxplot shows several outliers on the lower end of the distribution.
- Petal Length: There are no outliers, and the boxplot illustrates significant differences in the lengths of petals across different species.
- Petal Width: Similar to petal length, there are no outliers, and the boxplot highlights differences in petal widths among species.

Overall, the distributions of sepal length, petal length, and petal width appear relatively symmetric, with no clear outliers. However, sepal width shows some outliers on the lower end of the distribution. This analysis provides insights into the characteristics of the Iris dataset and helps in understanding the distribution of features and the presence of outliers.
