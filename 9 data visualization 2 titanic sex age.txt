Observations:

The box plot provides a visual representation of the distribution of ages for each gender, categorized by survival status (survived or not).

For both genders, the median age of those who survived appears to be slightly lower compared to those who didn't survive.

The interquartile range (IQR) for females who survived is narrower compared to females who didn't survive, indicating less variability in ages among female survivors.

For males, the IQR for those who survived is slightly wider compared to those who didn't survive, suggesting a broader range of ages among male survivors.

There are outliers present in both male and female categories, especially among males who survived.

Overall, there seems to be a difference in age distribution between survivors and non-survivors, with a notable variation across genders.
